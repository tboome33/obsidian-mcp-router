# Changelog

All notable changes to `obsidian-mcp-router` (the npm package + Claude Code plugin) are documented here. Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), versioning is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

For per-version detail (architecture decisions, alternatives considered, deferred work), see [ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md). This file is the user-facing summary.

## [Unreleased]

### Documentation / convention change (no code change in this repo)

- **Click-to-open links in chat** — when the bridge plugin (`tboome33/obsidian-mcp-router-bridge`) is ≥ v0.2.0, Claude formatting rule in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` emits markdown links of the form `[label](https://127.0.0.1:<vault-port>/open/<url-encoded-path>)` instead of the previous inline-code `obsidian://` URI format. A click in Claude Code's terminal dispatches the http URL → browser hits the bridge's new `GET /open/<path>` public-route → bridge calls `app.workspace.openLinkText` → Obsidian navigates to the file → tab auto-closes. No copy-paste. Falls back to the inline-code `obsidian://` format when the bridge is too old or the endpoint returns 404.
- Bridge plugin v0.2.0 adds the `GET /open/<path>` route via Local REST API's `addPublicRoute()` (loopback-only, no auth — security analysis in the bridge's `CHANGELOG.md` and `README.md#click-to-open`).
- Router-side: no code change. The convention update lives in the user's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`; no router release is required, but users who want click-to-open must update the bridge to ≥ v0.2.0 in each vault.

## [0.8.10] — 2026-05-18

Third (and last) of three graphify-borrowed Tier 1 patches (see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) and the wiki page [`2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap`](./wiki/decisions/2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap.md) item T1.C). Closes the Tier 1 train by enforcing **topology-equality short-circuits** on two derivative-content code paths so re-running with the same input costs zero writes and zero commits.

### Added

- **`src/helpers/wiki-fingerprint.mjs`** — port of graphify's `_canonical_topology_for_compare` pattern (`watch.py` rebuild path) to JS:
  - `canonicalise(text)` — normalise CRLF → LF, strip trailing whitespace per line, collapse trailing blank lines, ensure trailing newline. Narrow on purpose: preserves leading whitespace (matters for markdown lists), internal blank lines, internal whitespace.
  - `canonicalHash(text)` — SHA-256 truncated to 128 bits (32 hex chars) of the canonicalised text. Deterministic across runs.
  - `contentIsUnchanged(filePath, newContent)` — fastest path for "should I skip this write?"; returns true iff the existing file canonicalises to the same hash as `newContent`. Returns false if the file is missing.
  - `computeFingerprint(cwd, relativePaths)` — single fingerprint for a SET of files (sorted, deduplicated, missing files treated as empty). Used by the hot-cache hook to dedup re-prompts.
  - `readFingerprint(filePath)` / `writeFingerprint(filePath, fp)` — sidecar I/O for the dedup state. Silent-fail on write (degrades to pre-v0.8.10 re-prompt behaviour).
- **`tests/wiki-fingerprint.test.mjs`** — 37 cases covering canonicalisation invariants, hash determinism, content-unchanged file I/O, set-fingerprint order-independence + dedup + missing-file handling, sidecar read/write round-trip, malformed-fingerprint rejection, and an integration scenario walking the full hot-cache dedup loop. 198/198 total tests passing.

### Changed

- **`hooks/hot-cache-update-prompt.mjs`** — after detecting wiki changes, computes a fingerprint of the substantive (non-`hot.md`) changed files. If the fingerprint matches what was stored after the previous fire (in `.vault-meta/hot-prompt-fingerprint`), exits silently. Stores the new fingerprint after each fire. Breaks the re-prompt loop that happened when Claude saw the nudge but didn't refresh `hot.md` — the next Stop hook used to fire again with identical state. Whitespace-only edits to wiki files also no longer trigger re-prompts (canonical equivalence is the dedup key).
- **`skills/wiki-fold/SKILL.md`** — new step 4.5 ("Topology-equality short-circuit") instructs the skill to read the existing fold page, canonicalise both bodies, and **skip the write + index update + log entry triplet** if they match byte-for-byte. The "Idempotency contract" section now reads as a two-part guarantee: structural (deterministic naming + sorted output + ISO timestamps) AND operational (the step-4.5 short-circuit enforces it at the disk level). Re-running `/wiki-fold` with the same window now costs one read and zero writes.

### Why

- The PostToolUse auto-commit hook commits every write that touches `wiki/`. Without the short-circuits, two no-op patterns polluted `git log` over time:
  1. `/wiki-fold` re-runs with the same window produced byte-equivalent fold pages but `write_file` still touched the file, the auto-commit recorded a commit, and `git log` accumulated empty "no-op fold" entries. Worse: the auto-commit log was sometimes the ONLY entry between meaningful work, making the history harder to scan.
  2. The Stop hook re-fired the hot.md refresh nudge on every conversation turn that touched wiki/, even when state was identical to what it had just prompted about. Claude rightly ignored the duplicate nudges, but they cluttered the conversation transcript with `WIKI_CHANGED` noise.
- graphify hit the exact same family of issues and solved both with the canonical-equality pattern (`_canonical_topology_for_compare` for the graph file, `topology-equality post-rebuild check` for skipping clustering re-runs). The pattern transfers verbatim — only the format-specific canonicalisation differs (their JSON-sorting → our markdown line-stripping).

### Tests

- 198/198 passing — 161 from v0.8.9 + 37 new wiki-fingerprint cases.
- `package.json` `test` script extended to include `tests/wiki-fingerprint.test.mjs`.

### Backward compatible

- The fingerprint helper is a new module. `hooks/hot-cache-update-prompt.mjs` imports it via relative path `../src/helpers/wiki-fingerprint.mjs` — works for users who installed via `git clone` + `npm link` (the canonical setup); also works for `npm install` distribution because `src/` is in `package.json` `files`.
- The wiki-fold skill change is purely additive (a new step 4.5 between existing steps 4 and 5). Folds without changes now produce a "no changes written" output instead of a write-cycle, but the wire shape of the result is the same.
- `.vault-meta/hot-prompt-fingerprint` is a sidecar file the user can safely delete to reset the dedup state (next Stop hook will then re-fire as before). Recommended `.gitignore` entry: `.vault-meta/`.
- No tool surface change, no MCP-protocol change, no breaking change.

## [0.8.9] — 2026-05-18

Second of three graphify-borrowed Tier 1 patches (see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) and the wiki page [`2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap`](./wiki/decisions/2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap.md) item T1.B). Adds IDF-weighted candidate scoring with dynamic seed selection — the algorithm that ranks pages against a free-text query and prevents weak-runner-up dilution.

### Added

- **`src/helpers/idf-score.mjs`** — port of graphify's `_compute_idf` + `_score_nodes` + `_pick_seeds` (`graphify/serve.py:300-325`) to pure JS:
  - `tokenise(text)` — lowercase + Unicode-aware non-word split + filter tokens ≤ 2 chars.
  - `computeIdf(documents)` — corpus-wide `idf(t) = log(1 + N / (1 + df(t)))`. Suppresses noise terms like `user`, `error`, `the` that appear in many documents.
  - `scoreCandidates({ query, candidates, idf })` — three-tier per-term scoring: exact ×1000, prefix ×100, substring ×1. `secondaryLabel` field matched at ×0.5 weight (use for folder paths / breadcrumbs). Returns candidates sorted by score descending.
  - `pickSeeds(scored, { maxSeeds=3, dominanceRatio=5 })` — returns the top candidate only when its score is more than 5× the runner-up (graphify's fix for issue #897 — dominant matches shouldn't be diluted by weak runner-ups). Otherwise returns up to `maxSeeds`.
  - `rankAndPick({ query, candidates, idf })` — one-shot convenience wrapping the three above.
- **`tests/idf-score.test.mjs`** — 40 cases covering tokenisation (Unicode, version strings, snake_case), IDF formula correctness + iterable input, exact/prefix/substring score tiers, secondary-label half-weight, alias support, IDF down-weighting of common terms, dynamic seed cutoff at exact ratio boundary, all-zeros fallback, and a regression test for graphify issue #897. 161/161 total tests passing.
- **`skills/wiki-query/SKILL.md`** — tier 2 ("index.md") rewritten as a three-step IDF-weighted ranking + dynamic-seed cutoff procedure that Claude follows when picking 1-3 candidate pages to drill into. Tier 5 ("synthesize") now requires confidence-aware citations using the `source_type` frontmatter introduced in v0.8.8 (`(extracted)` / `(inferred)` / `(synthesized)` annotations on every wikilink in the rendered answer).

### Why

- The previous `wiki-query` tier-2 selection ("scan for matching titles, pick 1-3 most relevant") had two recurring failure modes:
  1. **Equal weight per query token.** A question containing one common term ("user") and one rare term ("kelly") gave both equal weight, so a wiki with a `user notes` page and a `kelly criterion` page would surface both equally rather than recognising that "kelly" is the discriminating term. IDF down-weights common terms automatically.
  2. **Always-3-candidate drill.** Even when one page clearly dominated, the skill drilled into two more weak matches and the synthesis became muddled. Dominant-match-only cutoff (graphify's `_pick_seeds`) fixes this — if the top scores >5× the runner-up, drill into ONLY the top.
- The helper is the canonical implementation that T2.A (`wiki-neighbors`), T2.B (`wiki-path`), T2.C (`wiki-explain`), and T3.A (`wiki-export-graph` search bar) will all import for endpoint resolution and result ranking. Shipping it now means those downstream tools don't need to re-implement.
- Combined with v0.8.8's `source_type` vocabulary, the wiki-query answer now tells the reader at a glance whether each cited claim is grounded (`extracted`), interpreted (`inferred`), or synthesised (`synthesized`). Different trust levels become visible without manual frontmatter reading.

### Tests

- 161/161 passing — 121 from v0.8.8 + 40 new IDF-score cases.
- `package.json` `test` script extended to include `tests/idf-score.test.mjs`.

### Backward compatible

- The helper is a new module; nothing imports it yet from the main router runtime. Only `wiki-query` skill (instructions to Claude) consumes it conceptually.
- No tool surface change, no MCP-protocol change, no breaking change.
- v0.8.8's `source_type` annotations from `wiki-query` citations gracefully degrade to `(unmarked)` for pre-v0.8.8 pages without the frontmatter field.

## [0.8.8] — 2026-05-18

First of three graphify-borrowed Tier 1 patches (see [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) and the wiki page [`2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap`](./wiki/decisions/2026-05-18-graphify-roadmap.md) item T1.A for the design rationale). Two independent additions packaged together because they both address source-provenance hygiene.

### Added

- **`sanitizeLabel()` / `sanitizeContent()` / `sanitizeResponse()` helpers** in new `src/helpers/sanitize.mjs`. Strip ANSI CSI/OSC escape sequences and control characters from any string that came from a vault before it flows back through MCP into Claude's context. `sanitizeContent` additionally neutralises a narrow set of agentic-markup tokens (`<system-reminder>`, `<tool_use>`, `<*>`, `<assistant>`, etc.) by HTML-encoding the leading `<` — preventing a corpus-injected document from hijacking the model. Length caps default to 16 KiB for labels and 1 MiB for full-page content; both overridable per call site. 33 new test cases in `tests/sanitize.test.mjs` (121/121 total passing).
- **Wire-up in three tools** on the response path:
  - `src/tools/search.mjs` — every match string goes through `sanitizeResponse`.
  - `src/tools/search-smart.mjs` — semantic-search results (breadcrumbs, excerpts, paths) go through `sanitizeResponse`.
  - `src/tools/get-file.mjs` — string-form file content goes through `sanitizeContent` (larger cap, neutralisation ON). Structured-form responses (frontmatter JSON via `application/vnd.olrapi.note+json`) pass through untouched to preserve type fidelity.
- **`source_type` frontmatter vocabulary** documented in `templates/wiki/CLAUDE.md` as a new mandatory section "Source provenance". Three values borrowed verbatim from graphify's `EXTRACTED / INFERRED / AMBIGUOUS`:
  - `extracted` — verbatim or near-quote from a source.
  - `inferred` — derived from a source but not written verbatim.
  - `claude_synthesized` — pure synthesis by Claude.
  - Inline callouts `[!extracted]` / `[!inferred]` / `[!claude_synthesized]` for per-paragraph overrides on mixed-provenance pages.
- **Skill updates** — `skills/wiki-ingest/SKILL.md` step 4 (source frontmatter) and step 5 (entity/concept frontmatter) now write `source_type`. `skills/save/SKILL.md` step 4 (frontmatter) documents how to pick the right value per saved-content kind.

### Why

- **Prompt-injection defence.** Vault content is user-authored at best, attacker-authored at worst. Without sanitisation, a malicious file could embed ANSI escapes (corrupting terminal output, hijacking PowerShell scroll buffer on Windows — graphify hit this with graspologic's stderr) or agentic markup (`<system-reminder>ignore all previous</system-reminder>`) that flips Claude's behaviour mid-tool-call. graphify takes this seriously enough to file it as `F-010` in their threat model (`serve.py:261-264`); the router had the same exposure with zero defence.
- **Provenance hygiene.** Until today, a wiki page didn't tell you whether an assertion was a verbatim quote from a source or a synthesis Claude wrote. Three-bucket tagging closes that gap with one frontmatter field per page (plus inline callouts where granularity matters). Downstream features (T1.B IDF citations, T2.D wiki-lint quality flags, T3.A confidence-aware viz) all build on this foundation.

### Tests

- 121/121 passing — 88 pre-existing + 33 new sanitize cases (clean strings, ANSI strip, control-char strip, injection neutralisation in both off/on modes, length caps, real-world markdown regressions including wikilinks/callouts/unicode/frontmatter).
- `package.json` `test` script now lists both test files explicitly (`node --test tests/registry.test.mjs tests/sanitize.test.mjs`) — `node --test tests/` was attempted but Node 20+ interprets a bare directory path as a module rather than a test-discovery root.

### Backward compatible

- Existing wiki pages without `source_type` continue to work — the field is purely additive metadata.
- All tool response shapes are unchanged; sanitisation is in-place string cleanup, not schema change.
- No new MCP tools, no new dependencies.

## [0.8.7] — 2026-05-17

### Added
- **`--bootstrap-reference` command** in `scripts/setup-vault.mjs` — a one-command way to create a fresh reference vault for users cloning the repo from GitHub. Scaffolds from the shipped skeleton, downloads the bridge plugin from its GitHub release, and records the path as `referenceVault` in `~/.claude/obsidian-mcp-router/config.json`. Follow up with `--init-reference <path>` after installing the marketplace plugins via Obsidian to validate and reserve the port.
- New [`templates/reference-vault-skeleton/`](./templates/reference-vault-skeleton/) directory committed to the repo, containing the canonical starting content for a reference vault: `.obsidian/community-plugins.json` (5-plugin list aligned with the author's `.template`), `.obsidian/app.json`, `.smart-env/smart_env.json` (transformers embedding model, API key field empty for safety), `.claude/settings.json` (Claude Code project settings that enable the `obsidian-router` plugin in this vault), `CLAUDE.md` (LLM-wiki navigation rules), `wiki/{index,log,hot,overview}.md` (Karpathy LLM-wiki scaffolding), and a `README.md` documenting what's in and what's intentionally out.
- New "Fast path" section at the top of [`docs/reference-vault-setup.md`](./docs/reference-vault-setup.md) — points new users at `--bootstrap-reference` first; the existing manual procedure remains as the long-form reference for customization and troubleshooting.

### Why
- Before this change, anyone cloning the repo had no path to acquire the author's reference vault — `.template` lives only on the author's machine for licensing + secrets reasons (plugin `main.js` files are third-party copyrighted artifacts under MIT/GPL-3.0, and `obsidian-local-rest-api/data.json` contains a TLS cert + private key + API key in cleartext). The manual procedure required ~6 steps with the `mcp-router-bridge` folder-vs-id naming gotcha tripping up most first-time users.
- The fast path turns onboarding into one command + one Obsidian session (click "Install" on the 4 plugin prompts Obsidian raises from the shipped `community-plugins.json`) + one `--init-reference` finalizer. The plugin selection ships in the skeleton's `community-plugins.json` so the consumer's vault matches the author's set by default.

### Plugin acquisition strategy
- The **bridge plugin** (only required plugin not in Obsidian's marketplace) is auto-downloaded from `github.com/tboome33/obsidian-mcp-router-bridge/releases/latest/download/{main.js,manifest.json}` via Node's built-in `https` module — no new dependency.
- The **four marketplace plugins** (Local REST API, Smart Connections, Templater, Quiet Outline) are installed through Obsidian itself when the user opens the freshly-scaffolded vault: Obsidian sees their IDs in `.obsidian/community-plugins.json` without matching folders under `.obsidian/plugins/` and prompts to install.

## [0.8.6] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- **`obsidian-quiet-outline`** added to `OPTIONAL_PLUGINS` in `scripts/setup-vault.mjs`. Quiet Outline is a community plugin that replaces the core Obsidian Outline with a much better sidebar — searchable headings, collapse/expand, drag-to-resize, sync with scroll, markdown rendering of heading text. Newly bootstrapped vaults (and existing vaults synced via `--sync-plugins`) will now clone it from `.template` automatically.
- Operator note: install Quiet Outline once in `.template` via Obsidian's community plugin browser (or drop `main.js` + `manifest.json` + `styles.css` from the [v0.5.12 release](https://github.com/guopenghui/obsidian-quiet-outline/releases/tag/0.5.12) into `.template/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-quiet-outline/`), then enable it in `.template/.obsidian/community-plugins.json`. From that point on the plugin propagates with the rest.

### Why
- Core Outline plugin is minimal — no search, no collapse, must re-open the panel on every note change unless pinned. On the user's typical wiki note (1500-4500 words, 10-15 H2, 10-20 H3), this gets unwieldy. Quiet Outline fixes the ergonomics without changing the underlying convention (still relies on H1/H2/H3 hierarchy from v0.8.5 consigne).

## [0.8.5] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- **Mandatory heading-hierarchy consigne** in `templates/wiki/CLAUDE.md` (and the personal-mode customization in `.template/CLAUDE.md`). Every wiki page must have exactly one `# H1` at top + at least two `## H2` sections if > 200 words. Type-specific minimums per `type` frontmatter (`session` → Prompt/What happened/Outcome, `decision` → Context/Decision/Consequences, `concept` → Definition/Why it matters/Related, `reference` → Summary/Key takeaways/Source, etc.). The skill pushes back when content is too thin: file as a one-liner in `wiki/facts.md` instead of producing a flat single-section page.
- Light reinforcement of the rule in `skills/save/SKILL.md` step 5 ("Write the body") and `skills/wiki-ingest/SKILL.md` step 4 (source filing) + step 5 (entity/concept pages) — both now spell out the H2 sections per type and reference the CLAUDE.md rule.
- New [`docs/reference-vault-setup.md`](./docs/reference-vault-setup.md) — step-by-step guide to creating the reference vault that `setup-vault.mjs` clones from. Covers required vs. optional plugins, the `mcp-router-bridge` folder-vs-id naming gotcha (folder must be `mcp-router-bridge` to match the manifest id, even though the GitHub repo is `obsidian-mcp-router-bridge`), update workflow, and troubleshooting. Linked from the README install requirements (EN + FR).

### Fixed
- `scripts/setup-vault.mjs` — required-plugin check at line 64 now expects `mcp-router-bridge` (the actual plugin id from the upstream `manifest.json`) instead of `obsidian-mcp-router-bridge` (the GitHub repo name). Aligns with the canonical Obsidian convention that folder name must match the manifest id. Pre-existing vaults with the divergent name keep working — only newly bootstrapped vaults are affected.

### Why (headings hierarchy)
- Obsidian's **Outline** panel (and any heading-aware navigation) is empty on flat pages with only an H1 + paragraphs. Long notes become unscannable. Auto-generated content from `/save`, `/wiki-ingest`, etc. previously varied in structure; now it must obey a documented hierarchy.
- Documented in the vault consigne so the rule applies cross-skill (and to manual Claude conversations bound to the vault), not just the explicit skill invocations.

## [0.8.4] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- **`meta-setup` skill** now guides users through raising `skillListingBudgetFraction` in `~/.claude/settings.json` from the default 1% to 5% (recommended for router users — see below). Detects under-budgeted setups, asks for confirmation, merges the change without touching unrelated keys, and handles the Windows UTF-8 BOM edge case.
- README install section (EN + FR) — new callout explaining the recommendation, the symptom (`Skill listing will be truncated — N descriptions dropped`) it fixes, and pointing at `meta-setup` for interactive application.

### Why
- The router contributes ~30 skills (slash commands + skills) to Claude Code's skill listing. On a default install (`skillListingBudgetFraction: 0.01`), the budget is exceeded once router + Anthropic defaults + any other plugin are loaded, and skills like `/save`, `/wiki`, `/autoresearch` get truncated or dropped — silently breaking natural-language triggering.
- Recommended bump to `0.05` (5%) costs ~6k extra tokens per session and keeps the full listing intact. Existing users seeing the warning can apply the same fix manually or via `meta-setup`.

## [0.8.3] — 2026-05-08

### Changed
- **Skill listing budget cleanup** — trimmed descriptions of 13 slash commands that duplicate a skill of the same name (`autoresearch`, `canvas`, `defuddle`, `meta-add-vault`, `meta-setup`, `meta-status`, `obsidian-bases`, `save`, `wiki`, `wiki-fold`, `wiki-ingest`, `wiki-lint`, `wiki-query`). The skill now owns the rich natural-language triggering description; the command keeps only a one-line palette label that points back to the skill. Saves ~1500 tokens of skill-listing budget per session, eliminates the per-entry-cap warning that previously dropped 46 descriptions on busy setups.
- No behavioral change: slash commands still invoke the same skill body, natural-language triggers still resolve through the corresponding skill.

## [0.8.2] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Wiki auto-enrichment Phase 1** — 4-mode dial (`ClaudeAsk` / `Hybrid` / `FullAuto` / `off`) with runtime toggle and `.env` persistence (`OBSIDIAN_ROUTER_AUTO_ENRICH`). Mirrors the v0.8.0 lock-mode architecture.
- New MCP tool `set_auto_enrich_mode({ mode, persist? })` with case-insensitive + alias canonicalization (`ask`/`auto`/`semi`/`none`).
- New slash command `/obsidian-router:auto-mode <Mode>` with bilingual NL triggers + per-mode use-case bullets in the description.
- New `validateAutoEnrichMode(candidate, context)` helper exported from `src/index.mjs` — fall-through-with-warning on invalid env var (mirrors `validateLock`).
- `list_vaults` response gains 5th field `autoEnrichMode`.
- New [`docs/auto-enrichment.md`](./docs/auto-enrichment.md) (EN+FR) — full guide with use cases per mode + 4 placement channels.
- New `templates/wiki/CLAUDE.md` consigne with mode-dependent behavior at each of the 3 triggers (validation pin / result digest / topic-switch checkpoint).
- New `commands/auto-mode.md` slash command (Phase 1 toggle).
- New bilingual quick-reference PDFs ([FR](./docs/quick-reference-fr.pdf), [EN](./docs/quick-reference-en.pdf)) — 5 pages each, accessible 11pt fonts.
- `setup-vault.mjs` now clones `quick-reference-{fr,en}.pdf` into bootstrapped vaults via `ROOT_FILES_TO_CLONE`.

### Fixed
- **Critical (post-push, Codex audit)** — `set_auto_enrich_mode({ mode: "off", persist: true })` now writes `OBSIDIAN_ROUTER_AUTO_ENRICH=off` literally to `.env` instead of removing the line. Previously the line was deleted, but startup defaulted absent values to `ClaudeAsk` — silently re-enabling auto-suggestions on sensitive vaults at next restart. The success message was also lying ("off across restarts" → false).
- `commands/auto-mode.md` NL trigger ambiguity: phrases like "stop asking me" no longer auto-map to `FullAuto`; the command now disambiguates between `off` / `Hybrid` / `FullAuto` before invocation.
- `templates/wiki/CLAUDE.md` Trigger 2/3 FullAuto branches now explicitly restate the sensitivity filter gate (was implicit, easy to misread).
- Tests for `lock_vault` + `set_auto_enrich_mode` homedir refusal now assert that `~/.env` was NOT created/mutated when the call was rejected (parity fix).

### Tests
- 88/88 passing.

## [0.8.1] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Wiki auto-enrichment Phase 0** — Claude proactively suggests wiki saves at 3 triggers: validation pin (inline `🔖`), result-obtained digest, topic-switch checkpoint. Mode hardcoded to `ClaudeAsk` (always confirm).
- `templates/wiki/CLAUDE.md` ships the consigne; future vaults scaffolded via `/obsidian-router:wiki` get it automatically.
- README EN+FR callout with link to the placement guide.

### Note
- Plugin-side update only (no npm router package change). Existing vaults need to re-pull the consigne section into their own `CLAUDE.md`.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-05-03

### Added
- **Lock mode (single-vault isolation)** — `lock_vault({ vault, persist? })` and `unlock_vaults({ persist? })` MCP tools. While locked, every tool call to a different vault throws; cross-vault fan-out (`vault: "*"`) is refused; calls without explicit `vault` resolve to the locked one.
- New `OBSIDIAN_ROUTER_LOCKED=<vault>` env var, read at startup, written by `lock_vault({ persist: true })`.
- New slash commands `/obsidian-router:lock` and `/obsidian-router:unlock` with bilingual NL triggers.
- `list_vaults` response gains 4th field `lockedTo: <name>|null`.
- New `validateLock(candidate, vaults, context)` helper exported from `src/index.mjs`.
- New `applyLockGuard()` exported helper that monkey-patches `registry.resolveVault()` so every existing tool call site inherits the check.
- README EN+FR: new "Lock mode" section with three concrete cases (volatile, permanent for shared install, switching target).
- Tests: 19 new cases covering set/unset, persist round-trip, homedir refusal, hot-reload preserve.

### Fixed
- **Critical** — `samePath()` Windows case-insensitive comparison so a homedir refusal can't be bypassed by typing `C:\Users\donald` vs `C:\Users\Donald`.
- `upsertDotenvVar` now updates the FIRST occurrence (matches the reader convention in `bin/obsidian-mcp-router.mjs`).
- Hot-reload preserves the lock state across config reloads, but revalidates so disabling the locked vault drops the lock instead of bricking.

## [0.7.1] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- `list_vaults` exposes disabled vaults — `disabled: [{ name, type, reason }]` field surfacing what was skipped by `disabledVaults` config.

## [0.7.0] — 2026-05-02

### Added
- Per-workspace default vault resolution — 5-tier cascade: `OBSIDIAN_ROUTER_DEFAULT_VAULT` env > `VAULT_PATH` env auto-detection > `config.defaultVault` > first healthy local > first active.
- `setup-vault.mjs` writes `VAULT_PATH=<path>` into each bootstrapped vault's `.env` so opening Claude Code in a vault directory "just works".

## [0.6.0] — 2026-04-30

### Added
- Knowledge management skill stack (10 commands): `/wiki`, `/wiki-ingest`, `/wiki-query`, `/wiki-lint`, `/wiki-fold`, `/save`, `/autoresearch`, `/canvas`, `/defuddle`, `/obsidian-bases`.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-04-29

### Added
- Rebrand cleanup, integrated setup scripts, runtime hardening.

## [0.4.x] — 2026-04-28

### Added
- v0.4.0: frontmatter helpers (`get_frontmatter`, `set_frontmatter`, `merge_frontmatter`), `move_file`, `RestApiError` typed error class with categorized `kind` + `hint` fields.
- v0.4.1: onboarding skills (`meta-setup`, `meta-add-vault`, `meta-status`).
- v0.4.2: hot config reload (router watches `~/.claude/obsidian-mcp-router/config.json` and re-loads on changes).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-27
